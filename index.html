    Hello, my name is Charlie and I'm currently looking for part-time or full-employment. I'm a driven individual, with a lot to gain, and I'm looking for an employer that's keen to put me to the test and give me the opportunity to prove my worth. I currently live in Longstanton. (Cambridgeshire)
<br>
Since January this year (2022) I have been studying the basic concepts and principles of interactive web development, starting with html and CSS, before moving into JavaScript. I believe we are also going to take a look at react before the end of the "Skills Bootcamp" that I have been studying with.

<br>
<br>
Whilst studying I have learned about Github and Visual studio code use.
<br>
We then progressed onto defining elements on the page in html,
before then progressing onto manipulating the visual appearance and layout of these elements using CSS. html and CSS appears relatively straight forward to me and I believe that with consistent use I can master it.
<br>
<br>
We then moved onto JavaScript, which I have enjoyed the challenge of so far. I have been working on a project to test my understanding of JavaScript and html/CSS. The project is a simple web based blackjack game.
<br>
Github hosted version:
<br>
https://forever-blessed.github.io/Blackjack-game/
<br>
Github Repository:
<br>
https://github.com/Forever-Blessed/Blackjack-game
<br>
<br> 
What I can bring to the Team.
<br>
I value myself as a Team player and I'm always looking for cohesion and unity within a group. 
<br> 
I'm literate, and have strong people skills which I feel makes both teamwork, and communication with the public/clients/other businesses, an area that I excel in.
<br>
<br>

As an employee my focus's would be primarily on these efforts:<br>
Punctuality<br>
Efficiency<br>
Etiquette<br>
And generally trying to achieve the job to hand, to the highest standard possible, via the path of least resistance (the easiest, most logical, way).

<div class="portfoliotext"> 
  <p> During the time i have spent learning to write html, and css, with PurpleBeard -
  we have done a couple of tasks and exorcises aimed at building key skills and knowledge. 
  One of the first tasks that we did was to make a "space card". Making the card was tricky at 
  first, but i soon got the hang of it. (space card seen below)

Once i had made my card and got it looking good, (well in my opinion i got it looking good!) i decided to extend
the task and made a variety of "cards" that all sit next to each other on a different topic. I choose 
"Animated Tv programme" cards! Here they are!
