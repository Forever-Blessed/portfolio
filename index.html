<div class="portfoliotext"> 
  <p> During the time i have spent learning to write html, and css, with PurpleBeard -
  we have done a couple of tasks and exorcises aimed at building key skills and knowledge. 
  One of the first tasks that we did was to make a "space card". Making the card was tricky at 
  first, but i soon got the hang of it. (space card seen below)

Once i had made my card and got it looking good, (well in my opinion i got it looking good!) i decided to extend
the task and made a variety of "cards" that all sit next to each other on a different topic. I choose 
"Animated Tv programme" cards! Here they are!
